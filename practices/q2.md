# Question 2: Two Sum

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Example:

Input:
```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

Output:
```
[0, 1]
```

Explanation:
- nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
- Therefore, the indices of the two numbers are 0 and 1.

### Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

### Note:

You can solve this problem using various approaches such as brute force, using a hash map for efficient lookup, or sorting the array. Feel free to choose the approach that you prefer or find most suitable.
