# Question 3

### Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day. You are allowed to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design a function to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

### Example:

Input:
```
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
```

Output:
```
5
```

Explanation:
- Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6).
- Profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

### Note:

You can solve this problem using various approaches such as brute force, dynamic programming, or maintaining minimum and maximum values while traversing the array. Feel free to choose the approach that you prefer or find most suitable.
